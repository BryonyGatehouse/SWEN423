# Design: Patterns, Frameworks and Languages

Object-orientation is the basis for many different programming languages, frameworks and programming patterns. This course explores advanced topics in formal design techniques for OO Languages, OO Frameworks and OO Programming Patterns, and connects those formal designs with practical programming examples.

### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Describe what it might mean to label something with the phrase object-oriented.
2. Understand and use the mathematical metalanguage used to formally define object-oriented programming languages.
3. Understand and describe object-oriented designs of frameworks, patterns and APIs.
4. Compare different designs for object-oriented patterns, frameworks and languages.
5. Discuss, describe, and evaluate the applicability of those techniques, designs, and languages.
